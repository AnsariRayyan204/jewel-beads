# TODO: Fix addOrder Error in Checkout Page

- [x] Update `useOrders.ts` to include `addOrder` function that constructs and places an order
- [x] Update `checkout/page.tsx` to import `Shipping` type and pass shipping data to `addOrder`
- [x] Test the checkout flow to ensure orders are placed correctly and error is resolved (skipped by user)
